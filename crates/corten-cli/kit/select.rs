// corten ui {{version}}: select
//! A choice from a list, as the classes of the `<select>` you write, so it posts and works with
//! the keyboard as the platform's does:
//! `<select name={f.size} class={Select {}}><option>"S"</option></select>`. Where the browser
//! supports `appearance: base-select`, the open list is styled too.
