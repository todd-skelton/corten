// corten ui {{version}}: badge
//! A short label: a status, a count, a tag, as the classes of the element you write, so a
//! `title`, an id or a patch target is on the badge itself. Its tone and its emphasis are separate,
//! so one tone can be a filled status, a soft one and an outlined count:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! <span class={Badge { tone: BadgeTone::Success, emphasis: BadgeEmphasis::Solid }} title={tracking}>"Shipped"</span>
//! <span class={Badge { tone: BadgeTone::Success, emphasis: BadgeEmphasis::Outline }}>{count}" successful"</span>
//! ```
//!
//! The text of each tone and emphasis meets WCAG AA contrast in both themes (the kit's test).
