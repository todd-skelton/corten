// corten ui {{version}}: accordion
//! Sections that open one at a time: the classes of each `<details>` you write, with its
//! `<summary>`. A shared `name` makes them exclusive, and find-in-page opens the one that holds
//! the match, with no script:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! <details class={Accordion {}} name="faq" open><summary>"When do payouts go out?"</summary><p>"Every Friday."</p></details>
//! <details class={Accordion {}} name="faq"><summary>"What does it cost?"</summary><p>"Nothing to list."</p></details>
//! ```
