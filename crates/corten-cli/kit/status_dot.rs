// corten ui {{version}}: status_dot
//! A dot in a status's color, before the words that name it:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! <span class={Badge { tone: BadgeTone::Success, emphasis: BadgeEmphasis::Soft }}>
//!     <StatusDot tone={StatusTone::Success} />
//!     "Open"
//! </span>
//! ```
//!
//! The dot is drawn, not read (`aria-hidden`): color alone tells a status neither to everyone who
//! sees it nor to a screen reader, so the status is always in the text beside it. Where a row has
//! no room for the word, write it for screen readers only, beside the dot, rather than in a
//! `title`, which most of them do not read on a `<span>`.
