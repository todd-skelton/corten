// corten ui {{version}}: alert
//! A message the page calls out. Its heading and text are yours (`<h2>` to `<h6>` or `<strong>`,
//! then `<p>`). Its role follows its variant, so a screen reader interrupts the user only for what
//! needs them now: `Destructive` and `Warning` are `role="alert"` (read at once when a patch
//! brings one in, as a form's error is), `Success` is `role="status"` (read politely, though a
//! status brought in with its text is not read by every screen reader; the result of an action is
//! a toast, corten-ui's `Toaster`), and `Neutral` and `Info` have no role and are read in the
//! page's order.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! <Alert variant={AlertVariant::Destructive}>
//!     <strong>"Payment failed"</strong>
//!     <p>"Your card was declined."</p>
//! </Alert>
//! ```
